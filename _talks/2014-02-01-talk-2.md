This project investigates scalable recommendation systems based on matrix factorization, with a particular focus on Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithms applied to large-scale datasets.

The work begins with the implementation of baseline matrix factorization models and progressively advances toward content-aware and hybrid recommender systems. Special attention is given to challenges associated with data sparsity, scalability, and efficient optimization in large user–item interaction matrices.

Experiments are conducted on the MovieLens 32M dataset, enabling large-scale evaluation of model performance, convergence behavior, and recommendation quality. The project emphasizes rigorous experimental design, including performance benchmarking and representation learning analysis.

Ongoing work focuses on extending the baseline ALS framework to incorporate auxiliary information, improving recommendation accuracy while maintaining scalability. The long-term objective is to produce a journal or arXiv manuscript detailing methodological contributions and empirical findings.
