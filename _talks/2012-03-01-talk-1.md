This project proposes a Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh (MLC) loss function to improve the robustness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models when training on noisy and outlier-contaminated time-series data.

Traditional loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are highly sensitive to extreme values, which frequently occur in real-world datasets. This sensitivity often leads to unstable training and degraded forecasting performance in practical applications.

To address this limitation, the proposed MLC loss function combines the robustness properties of the Minkowski distance with the smoothness and numerical stability of the Log-Cosh function, resulting in a loss formulation that is less sensitive to noise while preserving useful gradient information.

The methodology involved designing the hybrid loss function, integrating it into standard LSTM training pipelines, and conducting extensive experiments on 10 years of malaria incidence data (2013–2023) obtained from public health records. The evaluation focused on robustness under varying noise levels and outlier contamination.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional loss functions in terms of robustness and forecasting accuracy, particularly in epidemiological time-series applications.

This work resulted in a first-author peer-reviewed publication in IEEE Access, a Q1-ranked journal indexed in Scopus and Web of Science.
