This project introduces a **Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh (MLC) loss function** to enhance the robustness of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models when learning from **noisy and outlier-contaminated time-series data**.

The proposed loss combines the robustness of the Minkowski distance with the smoothness and numerical stability of the Log-Cosh function, addressing key limitations of traditional loss functions such as MSE and MAE. The approach was evaluated on **10 years of malaria incidence data (2013–2023)**, demonstrating improved stability and forecasting accuracy under varying noise conditions.

This work resulted in a **first-author peer-reviewed publication** in *IEEE Access*, a Q1-ranked journal indexed in **Scopus** and **Web of Science**.
