This project introduces a **Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh (MLC) loss function** to enhance the robustness of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models when learning from **noisy and outlier-contaminated time-series data**.

The proposed loss combines the robustness properties of the **Minkowski distance** with the smoothness and numerical stability of the **Log-Cosh function**, addressing key limitations of traditional loss functions such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.

## Loss Function Formulation

Let $y_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$ denote the true and predicted values at time index $i$.  
The proposed Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh loss is defined as

$$
\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y})
=
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\left[\log\!\big(\cosh(y_i - \hat{y}_i)\big)\right]^p,
$$

where $p > 0$ is a tunable exponent controlling the trade-off between **robustness to outliers** and **error sensitivity**.

**Interpretation**
- $p = 1$: recovers the Log-Cosh loss  
- $p \approx 2$: exhibits MSE-like behavior  
- $p < 2$: improves robustness by downweighting extreme residuals

## Experimental Evaluation

The approach was evaluated on **monthly malaria incidence data spanning 10 years (2013–2023)**.

Key findings include:
- Improved training stability under noisy conditions  
- Reduced sensitivity to extreme outliers  
- More reliable long-horizon forecasting compared to MSE and MAE  

These results demonstrate that the proposed loss provides a **robust and stable training objective** for recurrent neural networks in real-world public health forecasting tasks.
