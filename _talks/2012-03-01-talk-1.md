This project presents a **Hybrid Minkowski–Log–Cosh (MLC) loss function** designed to improve the robustness of **LSTM models** on **noisy, outlier-contaminated time-series data**.

By combining a **Minkowski-style exponent** with the smoothness of the **Log-Cosh** function, MLC addresses the limitations of traditional losses like **MSE** and **MAE**, offering better stability and outlier resistance.

### Highlights
- Improved stability and accuracy under noise
- Matched standard loss functions in computational cost
- Outperformed MSE/MAE in long-range forecasting

This research led to a **first-author publication** in **IEEE Access (Q1)**.
