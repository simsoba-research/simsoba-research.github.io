### Project Overview
This research project introduces a **Hybrid Minkowski–Log-Cosh (MLC) loss function** designed to improve the robustness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models when applied to **noisy and outlier-contaminated time series data**.

The project was motivated by challenges encountered in real-world public health datasets, where traditional loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) often fail to provide stable and reliable training behavior.

### Key Contributions
- **Novel loss function:** Proposed the Minkowski–Log-Cosh (MLC) loss, combining robustness and smooth optimization properties  
- **Deep learning application:** Integrated the loss into LSTM architectures for time series forecasting  
- **Empirical validation:** Evaluated on real public health data, including malaria incidence time series  
- **Robustness analysis:** Demonstrated superior resistance to noise and outliers compared to standard losses
