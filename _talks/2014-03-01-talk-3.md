This project examines the **impact of online learning on university students' academic performance** during the COVID-19 pandemic using a **statistical and data-driven approach**.

Primary data were collected from students at the Universite de Kara, capturing academic outcomes, access to digital devices, internet quality, and learning conditions during periods of remote instruction. The analysis employed **descriptive and inferential statistical methods** to identify relationships between learning environments and student performance.

The findings provide empirical insights into the challenges of remote education in **resource-constrained settings** and inform recommendations for improving equity and resilience in higher education systems.

This work constitutes a **research project within my second Master's training**, building on my background in applied statistics and serving as a foundation for subsequent research in educational and social data analysis.  
**Status:** Ongoing.
