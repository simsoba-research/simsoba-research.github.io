This project investigates the effects of online learning on university students’ academic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic using a statistical and data-driven approach.

The study was motivated by the rapid transition to remote education and the resulting disparities in access to digital resources, internet connectivity, and learning environments. Primary data were collected from students at the Université de Kara, capturing information on academic outcomes, type of digital devices used, internet quality, and study conditions during lockdown periods.

The methodology involved data collection through structured questionnaires, followed by descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to identify relationships between learning conditions and academic performance. Emphasis was placed on understanding how technological and socio-economic factors influenced student success under emergency remote learning constraints.

The findings provided empirical insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with online education in resource-constrained settings and informed recommendations for improving resilience and equity in higher education systems.

This project constituted the Bachelor’s thesis research in Mathematics and Statistics and laid the foundation for subsequent work in applied statistics and educational data analysis.
