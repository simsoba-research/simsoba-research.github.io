This project focuses on the development of generative and multimodal artificial intelligence models for breast cancer diagnosis and staging, integrating histopathology images with structured clinical records.

Breast cancer diagnosis relies on heterogeneous data sources, including high-resolution histopathology slides and patient clinical information. Traditional approaches often treat these modalities independently, limiting diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. This project addresses this gap by exploring multimodal learning frameworks capable of jointly modeling visual and clinical data.

The methodology involves an extensive literature review on multimodal deep learning, medical image analysis, and generative AI, followed by the design of architectures that combine convolutional and transformer-based encoders for histopathology images with structured representations of clinical variables.

Ongoing work focuses on model prototyping, modality fusion strategies, and evaluation protocols for disease diagnosis and staging, with particular emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and clinical relevance.

This project is part of ongoing graduate research in Artificial Intelligence for Science, with the objective of producing a peer-reviewed publication in the medical AI domain.
