This project investigates **generative and multimodal AI models** for **breast cancer diagnosis and staging**, integrating **histopathology images** with **structured clinical records**.

The work addresses limitations of unimodal approaches by exploring **multimodal learning frameworks** that jointly model visual and clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. Current efforts focus on **model prototyping**, **modality fusion strategies**, and **evaluation protocols**, with emphasis on robustness and interpretability.

This project is an **ongoing research project within my second Master’s in Artificial Intelligence for Science**, with the objective of producing a **peer-reviewed publication** in the medical AI domain.  
**Status:** Ongoing.
