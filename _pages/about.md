Hello! I’m **Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA**, a **Google DeepMind Scholar** currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at **Stellenbosch University** through **AIMS South Africa**. My academic background includes a Master’s in **Mathematics (Statistics)** from PAUSTI as an **African Union Scholar**, and a Bachelor’s in **Mathematics and Statistics** from Université de Kara.

My work centers on **robust machine learning** and **time-series forecasting**, with a focus on designing models that perform reliably under noisy, real-world conditions. I’m particularly interested in how the choice of loss functions influences model behavior, and have developed new methods to improve both stability and accuracy in deep learning systems.

I recently published in **IEEE Access**, introducing a novel approach for robust LSTM-based forecasting, which demonstrated improved performance on 11 years of malaria surveillance data.

I’m passionate about applying AI in scientific and public health contexts, and I’m open to research collaborations at the intersection of theory and real-world impact.
