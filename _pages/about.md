Hello! I'm Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA. I am a Google DeepMind Scholar currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science at Stellenbosch University through AIMS South Africa. My research focuses on robust machine learning, time series forecasting, and natural language processing applications in scientific domains. I am passionate about developing resilient AI systems that can handle noisy, incomplete real-world data while maintaining interpretability. My previous work includes developing hybrid loss functions for robust LSTM-based time series forecasting. I hold an M.Sc. in Mathematics from PAUSTI as an African Union Scholar and a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from Université de Kara. I am always interested in collaborating on projects that bridge mathematical theory with practical AI applications for scientific discovery.
