Hello! I’m **Kouyakou-Abalo SIMSOBA**, a **Google DeepMind Scholar** pursuing an **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science** at **Stellenbosch University** through **AIMS South Africa**.

My research focuses on **robust machine learning** and **time-series forecasting**, especially designing learning objectives that remain stable and accurate under noisy, irregular real-world data.

---

## Research Focus

I investigate how the **choice of loss function** affects the performance and robustness of deep learning models, particularly those based on **LSTMs**. I explore alternatives to classical losses like MSE and MAE to improve model behavior in challenging conditions.

---

## Contribution

In a recent **IEEE Access** paper, I proposed a new loss function for robust LSTM-based time-series forecasting. The method improves accuracy and convergence speed, especially in the presence of outliers, and was validated on **11 years of malaria surveillance data**.

## Background

- **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence for Science**, AIMS South Africa / Stellenbosch University  
- **M.Sc. in Mathematics (Statistics)**, PAUSTI — African Union Scholar  
- **B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics**, Université de Kara  

My foundation in **mathematical statistics** supports my work in robust learning and model analysis.

---

I welcome collaborations in **scientific forecasting**, **public health**, and **robust deep learning**.
