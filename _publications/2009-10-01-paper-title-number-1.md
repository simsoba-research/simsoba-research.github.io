### Abstract
Robustness in deep learning is critical when dealing with real-world data contaminated by noise and outliers. This paper proposes a Hybrid Minkowski-Log-Cosh (MLC) loss function. By combining the properties of Minkowski and Log-Cosh functions, the proposed MLC loss function provides a more resilient training objective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. 

### Key Contributions
* **Robustness:** Significantly outperforms traditional MSE and MAE loss functions in the presence of noise.
* **Validation:** Tested on public healthcare datasets, specifically for Malaria incidence forecasting.
* **Implementation:** Introduction of the MLC loss function as a plug-and-play objective for deep learning models.
